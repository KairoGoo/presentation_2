# `Wannacry`
 `Wannacry` is a worldwide cyberattack in May 2017 by the wannacry ransomware cryptoworm and wannacry propagated through `eternal blue` which was developed by the United states national security agency, and `eternal blue` was stolen and leaked by a group called the shadow brokers a month prior to the attack. 

`Wannacry` targeted computers which were running the Microsoft Windows operating system.

# `Wannacry` propagation
At first, people assumed it propagated by the `phishing email`, but the initial infection was likely through an exposed vulnerable `SMB` port.

# Effect of `Wannacry`
 
The attack began on the `12th May, 2017` and it affected more than `200000 computers` across `150 countries`, and there were no reports of people getting their data back after paying ransom.
