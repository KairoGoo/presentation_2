# `Wannacry`
 `Wannacry` is a worldwide cyberattack in May 2017 by the wannacry ransomware cryptoworm and wannacry propagated through `eternal blue` which was developed by the United states national security agency, and `eternal blue` was stolen and leaked by a group called the shadow brokers a month prior to the attack. 

`Wannacry` targeted computers which were running the Microsoft Windows operating system.

# `Wannacry` propagation
At first, people assumed it propagated by the `phishing email`, but the initial infection was likely through an exposed vulnerable `SMB` port.

# Effect of `Wannacry`
 
The attack began on the `12th May, 2017` and it affected more than `200000 computers` across `150 countries`, and there were no reports of people getting their data back after paying ransom.

# What is Eternal Blue
A computer exploit developed by the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA).
There is three vulnerability of the eternal blue.
- Out of bound memory write.(Core, CVE-2017-0144)
- Bypass the length limit of memory writes.
- Attack the memory layout of data.

# How is the Vulnerability CVE-2017-0144 work?

The idea is create a SMB V1 request, after that Eternal Blue will scan and open the port 445. The port 445 is a port used for sharing files or resource between computers.

To open the port, we need to use this vulnerability, but how?

The idea is same as the buffer overflow, the work would be more complex and hard to understand, so I will use my own word to explain how this work.

There is a function called "SrvOs2FeaListSizeToNt" in this function if we input a very large input, then we could get what we want. But we could not call or use that function directly, so we found another function "SrvSmbOpen2". After we enter this function and call the vulnerability function, we input a number size is lager then 0xFFFF. Then the memory will overflow, the rest of the work would be same as the buffer overflow.

# What is SMB?

SMB (full name is Server Message Block) is a protocol server message block. It is a client/server, request/response protocol. Through the SMB protocol, files, printers, named pipes and other resources can be shared between computers. The SMB protocol works at the application layer and the session layer, and can be used on top of the TCP/IP protocol. SMB uses TCP139 ports and TCP445 ports.

# SMB Theoryï¼Ÿ

1. First the client sends an SMB negport request datagram, listing all the SMB protocol versions it supports. After the server receives the request message, it responds to the request and lists the version of the SMB protocol it wishes to use. If there is no available protocol version, it will return 0XFFFFH to end the communication.

2. After the protocol is determined, the client process initiates a user or shared authentication to the server, which is achieved by sending a SessetupX request packet. The client sends a username and password or a simple password to the server, and the server sends a SessetupX response packet to allow or deny the connection.

3. When the client and server have negotiated and authenticated, it sends a Tcon or TconX SMB datagram listing the name of the network resource it wants to access, and then sends a TconX response datagram to indicate whether the connection is accepted or not. reject.

4. After connecting to the corresponding resource, the SMB client can open a file through open SMB, read the file through read SMB, write the file through write SMB, and close the file through close SMB.






# Example Phase

 1. Download [Kali](https://www.kali.org/get-kali/ "Kali download page") and [Windows XP](https://isoriver.com/windows-xp-iso-download/ "Windows XP download page") virtual machines and install in the [VMware Workstation](https://www.vmware.com/ca/products/workstation-pro.html "VMware Workstation download page").

 2. Check the IP address of the target machine and ping it to see  if two machine are connected.

 3. Go to the Metasploit tools and search for the vulnerability, scan the IP address to see if it is vulnerable.
